# Face Detection using Haar Cascades with OpenCV

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using **Haar Cascade Classifiers** with OpenCV. The notebook applies machine learning techniques to detect human faces from images or video streams efficiently. The Haar cascades, trained on thousands of positive and negative images, are used to recognize face patterns in various lighting conditions and angles.

## Features

- Real-time face detection with OpenCV.
- Use of Haar Cascade Classifiers for robust detection.
- Adjustable parameters for optimizing detection speed and accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to start real-time face detection.
